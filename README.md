# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
The main objective of this task was to understand the characteristics that define a strong password and to evaluate the strength of various passwords using online tools. This hands-on exercise aims to deepen the understanding of password security best practices.

## Tools Used
* Online free password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com).

## Deliverables
* A report showcasing the password strength results and an explanation of the findings.

## Process Followed

1.  Password Creation:I created multiple passwords with varying levels of complexity.
2.  This involved experimenting with:
    * Different combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters.
    * Inclusion of numbers.
    * Inclusion of special symbols.
    * Variations in password length.
3. Strength Evaluation: Each created password was tested using an online password strength checker.
4.  Result Analysis:I noted the scores and feedback provided by the password strength tool for each password.
5.  Best Practices Identification:Based on the evaluation, I identified key best practices for creating strong passwords.
6.  Tips Documentation:I documented the tips learned from the evaluation process.

### Best Practices for Strong Passwords
Based on this task, the following best practices are crucial for creating strong passwords:
* Length:Longer passwords are significantly more secure. Aim for at least 12-16 characters, or even longer passphrases.
* Complexity:Combine a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* Uniqueness: Avoid using easily guessable information such as personal details, common words, or sequences.
* Avoid Common Patterns:Do not use simple patterns like "123456" or "qwerty".
* Use Passphrases:Consider using passphrases (sentences or sequences of random words) which are longer and often easier to remember than complex, short passwords.
* No Re-use:Never reuse passwords across different accounts.

### Impact of Password Complexity on Security
Password complexity directly affects a password's resistance to common attacks like brute-force and dictionary attacks.
* Brute-Force Attacks: These attacks involve an attacker trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.A longer and more complex password drastically increases the number of possible combinations, making a brute-force attack computationally infeasible.
* Dictionary Attacks:* These attacks use pre-compiled lists of common words, phrases, and previously leaked passwords. By including numbers, symbols, and mixed cases, and by avoiding common words, passwords become resistant to dictionary attacks.

## Interview questions from Task 6 with their answers:
1. What makes a password strong?
A strong password is typically long, ideally 12-16 characters or more, and incorporates a diverse mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It should be unique and not based on easily guessable personal information or common dictionary words.
2. What are common password attacks?
Common password attacks include brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks. Brute-force attacks involve systematically trying every possible character combination until the correct password is found, while dictionary attacks use pre-compiled lists of common words and phrases.
3. Why is password length important?
Password length is crucial because longer passwords significantly increase the number of possible character combinations, making them much harder and more time-consuming for attackers to guess, especially through brute-force methods.
4. What is a dictionary attack?
A dictionary attack is a type of password attack where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access by trying a list of common words, phrases, and frequently used passwords against a user's account.
5. What is multi-factor authentication?
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security system that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an account. These factors typically fall into three categories: something the user knows (like a password), something the user has (like a phone or security token), and something the user is (like a fingerprint or facial scan). (No direct citation in the provided text, but it's a standard cybersecurity concept related to authentication).
6. How do password managers help?
Password managers help users by securely storing and generating strong, unique passwords for all their online accounts. They eliminate the need for users to remember complex passwords and can often autofill login credentials, enhancing both security and convenience. (No direct citation in the provided text, but it's a standard cybersecurity concept related to password management).
7. What are passphrases?
Passphrases are a sequence of random words or a short, memorable sentence used as a password. They are often longer than traditional passwords and can be more secure due to their length, while also being easier for users to remember. (No direct citation in the provided text, but it's a standard cybersecurity concept).
8. What are common mistakes in password creation?
Common mistakes in password creation include using easily guessable information (like birth dates or names), using short passwords, using common words or simple sequences, and reusing the same password across multiple accounts. These practices significantly weaken password security.


## Learning Outcome
This task significantly enhanced my understanding of password security principles and best practices. I learned the practical implications of password length and complexity in defending against various cyber threats. This exercise underscored the importance of creating unique, strong, and memorable passwords or passphrases to protect online accounts.
